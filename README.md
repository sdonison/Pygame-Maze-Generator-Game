# Overview

This is a random maze generator game. When the game begins, the code randomly draws a maze for the user to solve, placing the finish randomly in the bottom right of the maze. When the user completes the maze, "Congratulations!" is displayed to the screen. After 5 seconds, a new maze is generated.

I wanted to practice learning how to code in pygame and a random maze generator seemed simple enough to start with. I already had experience with Python's Arcade library, so I wanted to try something that I never had experience with before.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I followed a YouTube tutorial posted by CoderSpace to write the code that generates the maze. The player sprite was created using Sprite Creator U by escac on Streamlabs. The music is created by The Cynic Project at pixelsphere.org.

This game is coded in Python using the pygame library. The random library was used to generate the maze.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Change direction of player sprite depending on movement.
* Animate player sprite.
* Add difficulty levels by changing tile size based on user selection.
